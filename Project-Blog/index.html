        <div id="thoughts"><p id="text">I've never written a blog before. I barely even know how to start. I guess I will just start at the beginning and work my way from there.</p>
        <p id="text">Hi. My name is Sam. All my friends call me Yuki though. That nickname dates back all the way to eighth grade, but that's not what I'm going to be talking about.</p>
        <p id="text"> I love just about everything artisic. Be that pictures, movies, games, flower arrangements. You name it. If it is considered a form of art, I probably like it some way or another. I think of myself as artistic, but admittedly, I'm really hard on myself. I tend to put myself down and I feel like I'm not good enough. Doesn't stop me from trying though.</p>
        <p id="text"> My first year of college. I went in with my major being graphic design and my minor being programming. I saw myself working on games in the future. I thought it would be fun and I coud make some really cool stuff. I wanted to show that I had the ability to do something amazing and artistic. Let's just say your plans never work out how you want them to. I only went through college for one semester. Not because I hated college. Quite the opposite. College was a fun experience. Life had thrown hurdles at me that I wasn't ready for. I got to learn a little bit of graphic design. Mostly worked on 3DS Max. Made all sorts of neat 3D projects and it was a lot of fun. I hadn't learned anything on the side of programming tthough.</p>
        <p id="text"> Blah blah blah, life happened and here I am, seven years later, still going with the flow and living life as it comes. I've made several friends where I'm at. One of them is a programmer. I never really knew what she did for her company (and I still don't really), but that she could program. She doesn't speak of her job much and when I asked, her anwsers were always short and simple. I don't think she was trying to hide anything from me. I just think I was asking the wrong questions. Through her, I was able to learn about pogramming.</p>
        <p id="text"> For what I am about to tell you: this is a <strong>judge free zone!</strong></p>
        <p id="text"> December 31st, New Years Eve. I think it was actually past new years at this point. I was hanging with my programming friend. She had already been drinking by the time I got to her house, but I helped her further along. I will admit to accidently getting my friend insanely drunk. I had brought Sake for us to share. We both love Sake and it gave us something to drink while we talking about random things. Our position in life was one of the many topics. She had been sharing about her work. Shesaid that she had a program through her work that taught young women programming. She was very excited because she loves to see women succeed and programming is her passion. I was a little baffled.<em> Why has she never told me of this program? She knows what I'm doing now for work. She knows how much I'd love to get out and find a carreer that suits me. Well, I guess she just never thought of it.</em></p>
        <p id="text"> "Why have you <em>never</em> told me this before!?"</p>
        <p id="text"> She was a little baffled. I don't know if it was her being drunk that made her want to share, but in a way, she saved me. She told me if I was serious, she would send the information and I could learn programming. That's a lot to decide. Yeah, I could learn what I want, ditch out, and find something else, but I'm not going to do that. I want to be a part of something. Even if it was a secondary choice, I did want to learn programming.</p>
        <p id="text"> I'll admit, it took me about a week to finally get back to her on the program information, but I did! She was confused at first. Not sure if she forgot the whole conversation, but I think I jogged her memory.</p>
        <p id="text"> That's how I started as a programmer.</p></div>

        <h2 id="thought">Thoughts on Programming</h2>
        <h5>Posted on 2/22/2018</h5>

       <div id="thoughts"> <p id="text">You never know if you like something until you try it. I never knew I'd like programming until I starting learning it. I'm not sure why, but it doesn't feel as foreign and confusing as I thought it would be. I'm sure there are things that will be confusing to me, but over time, i'll be the same as drinking water. Second nature.</p>
         <p id="text"> Programming is beautiful. I don't think I'm that good, but I know I have a lot to learn. Thinking about how much code I wrote, codes I remember, and the design structure of it all amazes me. I'm finding I really love programming. My friends are happy for me to. I think I baffle them a little when I got on an excited tangent about something I did using code or what I created. I can't help it. I get so excited that I feel like I'm actually creating something neat. I really hope I continue to make awesome stuff in the future. Scratch that. I <em>know</em> I'm going to make some really wicked stuff. I <em>know</em> I'm going to be apart of something awesome.</p></div>
