        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong><em> Blanch and peel the tomatoes:</em> Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. As the water is heating make shallow cuts in a cross pattern at the tip ends of the tomatoes (this will make the tomatoes easier to peel).<br>Once the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. Put the tomatoes in the hot water and blanch for 1 minute.<br>Remove with a slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle. Then gently peel off the tomato skins. Cut out the stem base with a paring knife.<br>Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juices and seeds.<br><strong>Step 2:</strong> <em>Preheat oven</em> to 450째F (230째C) with a rack in the top slot of the oven.<br><strong>Step 3: </strong><em>Chop tomatoes, toss them with garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt and pepper:</em> Finely chop the tomatoes and place them in a medium bowl. Mix in the minced garlic, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and the balsamic vinegar.<br>Stir in the thinly sliced basil and add salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more to taste. Note, tomatoes love salt; you may need to add more than you expect.<br><strong>Step 4: </strong><em>Toast the baguette slices:</em> Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. Brush one side of each slice with olive oil (a pastry brush helps here) and place olive oil-side down on a baking sheet or roasting pan.<br>The baguette slices will toast best in the top rack of your oven, so you may need to work in batches to toast them all.<br>When the oven has reached 450째F (230째C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges.<br><em>If you want you can toast the bread slices without coating them first in olive oil. Toast them until lightly browned on both sides. Then cut a clove of garlic in half and rub over one side of the toast. Then brush with olive oil.</em><br><strong>Step 5: </strong><em>Serve toasted bread with tomato mixture:</em> Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up (the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier keeping the bread from getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes).<br>Either serve the toasts plain with a bowl of the tomato bruschetta mixture on the side for people to top their own, or use a spoon to gently top each toasted bread slice with some of the tomato mixture. If you top each slice individually, do it right before serving.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.<br><strong>Step 2: </strong>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.<br><strong>Step 3: </strong>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).<br><strong>Step 4: </strong>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.<br><strong>Step 5: </strong>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.<br><strong>Step 2: </strong><em>To make the crust:</em> In a small bowl, mix the cracker crumbs with the melted butter and the sugar together until evenly moistened. Press the crumb mixture onto the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake the crust until golden brown, about 10 to 12 minutes. Cool the pan on a rack.<br><strong>Step 3: </strong>Lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or with a hand-held mixer, cream the cream cheese on medium speed until smooth. Gradually add the sugar and beat until light and fluffy. (Stop mixing and scrape down the sides of the bowl and beaters as needed.) Beat in the sour cream. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla and cream. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.<br><strong>Step 4: </strong>Bake until the top of the cheesecake is lightly browned, but the center still jiggles slightly, about 45 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan on a rack. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight before serving.<br><strong>Step 5: </strong>To remove the cake from the pan, run a knife or offset spatula around the edges to release the edges from the pan. Open the springform pan and remove the ring.<br><strong>Step 6: </strong>Cut the cheesecake into wedges and serve with berries or a raspberry sauce if desired.
